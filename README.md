## Getting help

Any issues/requests/problems/comments that are not yet addressed on this page can be posted on [Github issues](https://github.com/ndierckx/NOVOLoci/issues) and I will try to reply the same day.

Or you can contact me directly through the following email address:

If your assembly was unsuccessful, you could already add the log file and the configuration file to the mail, this could help me to identify the problem!
